# Life Expectancy Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks from a team project focused on analysing global life expectancy data and building predictive models. The goal of the project was to explore the dataset, derive insights, and develop models capable of predicting life expectancy based on country-level indicators.

## Project Overview

Key objectives of the project:

- Clean and analyse life expectancy data to identify trends and patterns  
- Visualize key relationships and distributions across features  
- Investigate correlations and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) scores to address multicollinearity and improve model performance  
- Build predictive models for life expectancy using two approaches:  
  - **Ethical model:** Uses minimal data for countries that do not consent to share sensitive information  
  - **Advanced model:** Uses all available data for the most accurate predictions

## Repository Contents

- `life_expectancy_analysis.ipynb` – Contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, correlation/VIF investigations, and modelling  
- `predictor_function.ipynb` – Contains the function that takes user inputs and returns life expectancy predictions using the trained models
